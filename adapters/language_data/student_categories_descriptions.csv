Anarchist punk,"Punk fashion is the clothing, hairstyles, cosmetics, jewellery, and body modifications of the punk counterculture. Punk fashion varies widely, ranging from Vivienne Westwood designs to styles modeled on bands like The Exploited to the dressed-down look of North American hardcore. The distinct social dress of other subcultures and art movements, including glam rock, skinheads, greasers, and mods have influenced punk fashion. Punk fashion has likewise influenced the styles of these groups, as well as those of popular culture. Many punks use clothing as a way of making a statement.

Other accoutrements worn by some punks included: BDSM fashions, fishnet stockings (sometimes ripped), spike bands and other studded or spiked jewelry, safety pins (in clothes and as body piercings), silver bracelets and heavy eyeliner worn by both men and women. Many female punks rebelled against the stereotypical image of a woman by combining clothes that were delicate or pretty with clothes that were considered masculine, such as combining a Ballet tutu with big, clunky boots.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_fashion
Emo,"Emo /_i_mo_/ is a rock music genre characterized by emotional, often confessional lyrics. It emerged as a style of post-hardcore and hardcore punk from the mid-1980s Washington D.C. hardcore punk scene, where it was known as emotional hardcore or emocore and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace. In the early–mid 1990s, emo was adopted and reinvented by alternative rock, indie rock and/or punk rock bands such as Sunny Day Real Estate, Jawbreaker, Cap'n Jazz, and Jimmy Eat World. By the mid-1990s, bands such as Braid, the Promise Ring, and the Get Up Kids emerged from the burgeoning Midwest emo scene, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the genre. Meanwhile, screamo, a more aggressive style of emo using screamed vocals, also emerged, pioneered by the San Diego bands Heroin and Antioch Arrow. Screamo achieved mainstream success in the 2000s with bands like Hawthorne Heights, Silverstein, Story of the Year, Thursday, the Used, and Underoath.

Often seen as a subculture, emo also signifies a specific relationship between fans and artists and certain aspects of fashion, culture and behavior. Emo fashion has been associated with skinny jeans, black eyeliner, tight t-shirts with band names, studded belts, and flat, straight, jet-black hair with long bangs. Since the early to mid 2000s, fans of emo music who dress like this are referred to as ""emo kids"" or ""emos"" and known for listening to bands like My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Hawthorne Heights, The Used, and AFI. The emo subculture was stereotypically associated with social alienation, sensitivity, misanthropy, introversion and angst. Purported links to depression, self-harm and suicide, combined with its rise in popularity in the early 2000s, inspired a backlash against emo, with bands such as My Chemical Romance and Panic! at the Disco rejecting the emo label because of the social stigma and controversy surrounding it.

Emo and its subgenre emo pop entered mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the success of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional and many artists signed to major record labels. Bands such as My Chemical Romance, AFI, Fall Out Boy and the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus continued the genre's popularity during the rest of the decade. By the early 2010s, emo's popularity had declined, with some groups changing their sound and others disbanding. Meanwhile, however, a mainly underground emo revival emerged, with bands such as The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die and Modern Baseball, some drawing on the sound and aesthetic of 1990s emo. During the late 2010s, a fusion genre called emo rap was mainstream, with some of emo rap's most famous artists including Lil Peep, XXXTentacion and Juice Wrld. 

Emo as a subculture of people began in the mid-late 1990s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, emo fashion was clean-cut and tended towards geek chic,[232] with clothing items like thick-rimmed glasses resembling 1950s musician Buddy Holly, button-down shirts, t-shirts, sweater vests, tight jeans, converse shoes, and cardigans being common.[9] In January 2002, the Honolulu Advertiser described emo people as ""intentionally unshowy"": ""these guys often ride bicycles, keep diaries, write poetry and hang out at coffee shops. They prefer art films to Hollywood blockbusters and frequent independent music stores. They are usually shy and introspective.""[232] Some emo bands at the turn of the 21st century, such as The Promise Ring, adopted a geek chic look.[9]

Although originally more geek chic-influenced, emo fashion began to change to its more famous, goth-influenced look that appeared in the 2000s. A lot of the change came from the hardcore punk, screamo and metalcore bands in the mid-late 1990s and early 2000s. The first origins date back to the mid-1990s San Diego screamo scene. The scene's bands, such as Heroin, Antioch Arrow and Swing Kids, and participants in this scene were often called ""spock rock"", in reference to their black-dyed hair with straight fringes.[199] As the vocalist of Swing Kids, Justin Pearson had choppy spikes protruding from the back of his head alongside straight fringes, which was a prototype for the emo haircut. After the 1998 release of the music video for ""New Noise"" by Swedish hardcore punk band Refused, straight, black hair with long, swooped bangs spread as a common fashion in hardcore punk. Refused adopted this haircut alongside black clothing and nail polish at a time when emo fashion was more geek chic-oriented.[199] Metalcore band Eighteen Visions was the band that expanded the prototype of later emo fashion. As many hardcore bands in the 1990s had a hypermasculine image characterized by shaved heads, baseball caps and tattoos, Eighteen Visions wanted to rebel against this image. Inspired by the look of bands like Orgy and Unbroken, Eighteen Visions dressed in effeminate fashion, including skinny jeans, straightened hair, swooped bangs, black clothes and eyeliner. Emphasizing their fashion of their music, they were labeled ""fashioncore"".[199][233] Fashioncore became a popular trend in hardcore and metalcore in the early 2000s, and other bands labeled as fashioncore included Avenged Sevenfold, Bleeding Through and Atreyu.[234][235][236] Influenced by the members of Eighteen Visions, emos in the early 2000s became increasingly experimental with their hair, making use of layers, asymmetrical fringes and cutting hair using razorblades. Haircuts such as the Bob and the A-Line cut were also popular.[199] Moreover, early-mid 2000s emo and pop punk bands like My Chemical Romance, AFI, and Good Charlotte wore black clothes and eyeliner.[237][238][239] These bands were often inspired by other bands that adopted a goth look, such as the Misfits and The Cure.[240][238][241]

Emo fashion in the mid-to-late 2000s included skinny jeans, tight T-shirts (usually short-sleeved, and often with the names of emo bands), studded belts, Converse sneakers, Vans and black wristbands.[242][243] Thick, horn-rimmed glasses remained in style to an extent,[242] and eye liner and black fingernails became common during the mid-2000s.[244][245] The best-known facet of emo fashion is its hairstyle: flat, straight, usually jet-black hair with long bangs covering much of the face,[243] which has been called a fad.[243] Emo fashion has been confused with goth[246] and scene fashion.[247]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo 
Normal,"Normcore is a unisex fashion trend characterized by unpretentious, normal-looking clothing. Normcore fashion includes jeans, t-shirts, sweats, button-downs, underpants, socks, and sneakers. Clothing is considered to be normcore when it is both cute and comfortable, and is viewed as 'normal' by all people.

Normcore wearers are people who do not wish to distinguish themselves from others by their clothing.[12] This is not to mean that they are unfashionable people who wear whatever comes to hand, but that they consciously choose clothes that are functional and undistinguished ñ except perhaps for a visible label to impart prestige. The ""normcore"" trend has been interpreted as a reaction to fashion oversaturation resulting from ever faster-changing fashion trends.[13]

Normcore clothes include everyday items of casual wear such as t-shirts, hoodies, polos, short-sleeved shirts, jeans and chino pants, but not items such as neckties or blouses. These clothes are worn by men and women alike, making normcore a unisex style.[13]

Clothes that meet the ""normcore"" description are mainly sold by large fashion and retail chains such as The Gap,[14] Jack & Jones, Superdry, Jigsaw, and Esprit. They are generally cheaply produced in East Asian countries. Many other retailers such as Marc O'Polo, Woolrich, Desigual, Closed, and Scotch & Soda produce normcore-like clothes combined with individual design ideas.[13]

A variation on this concept for women has been called menocore, after menopause.[15] Designer brands associated with this style of dressing since the 1980s include Eileen Fisher, JJill and Donna Karan. It is loose, comfortable clothing, usually in light or neutral colors, that fits a variety of informal social situations, from shopping to eating lunch in a restaurant. The style suggests that the wearer is mature and self-confident, that she is not seeking attention from men, and that she has leisure time and wealth. Because of these associations, it has class connotations and can be stereotyped as the dressing style of a woman who is middle-aged or older and already wealthy enough that she does not need the kind of lucrative employment that would require wearing either a more formal style of clothing or a work uniform.[15] The style may be adopted by women outside the stereotype as an aspirational style, to suggest that they wish to eventually attain the financial security, leisure, and other lifestyle elements available to older, wealthier women.[15]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normcore 
Teacher's pet,"Smart casual is an ambiguously defined Western dress code that is generally considered casual wear but with smart (in the sense of ""well dressed"") components of a proper lounge suit from traditional informal wear. This interpretation typically includes dress shirt, necktie, trousers and dress shoes, but worn with an odd-coloured blazer or a sports coat instead.

Smart casual formed as a dress code in the 20th century, originally designating a lounge suit of unconventional colour and less heavy and thus more casual fabric, possibly with more casual cut and details. As the one-coloured lounge suit came to define informal wear, thus uneven colours became associated with smart casual. The defintion of smart casual and business casual thus became virtually undistinguishable from the 1950s, implying a more casual suit than the traditional, usual dark suit in heavy cloth.

Since the counterculture of the 1960s in the Western world, different Western cultures and events[disambiguation needed] can have varying expectation of the dress code, especially with regards to necktie, and in warmer climates sometimes even with regards to a jacket at all. Therefore the designation of certain clothing pieces as smart casual is disputed, as is its distinction, if any, from business casual.

Personal judgment is required to interpret the ill-defined term smart casual based on its context, theme, people, location, weather and spirit. Italian fashion house Brioni explains smart casual is not an issue of inventory or classification but rather knowledge and good taste to understand the environment; demonstrating that smart casual during summer in Sardinia is different to smart casual during winter in Toronto.[5] An Australian freelance fashion director remarks, ""Smart Casual is the dress code most open to interpretation and the one least understood"", and advises wearing fresher colors, lighter, softer materials, patterned, relaxed, thoughtful, less structured, clean and not confrontational apparel, with fabrics like linen, cashmere, fine wool and cotton that are freshly laundered.[5]

Global men's fashion magazine Topman emphasizes the flexibility of smart casual.[6] An individual's personality and pleasure of clothing choice defines the dress code provided that the attire is a multi-purpose outfit that is acceptable for formal occasions, dating or casual social gatherings. Topman explains casual and formal clothing pieces are mixed and matched, and illustrates a smart casual outfit can include a mixture of jeans, blazers, sport coats, sweaters, necktie, a pair of Brogue shoes, dress shirts or a pair of Converse shoes.

Norwegian and American cruise line brand Royal Caribbean International clarifies smart casual for main dining on-board its fleet.[7] Blazers, trousers, neckties or shirts are acceptable but shorts, jeans or t-shirts are unacceptable for men. Dress, casual dresses, or pantsuits are acceptable for women.

Global women's magazine Cosmopolitan in South Africa interprets smart casual as the way most South African women dress for work.[8] In addition to work, the outfit is also interchangeable for use at large or small daytime parties, and wearing a dress shirt with elegant accessories is suggested.

Australian state newspaper The Sunday Mail in Brisbane defines a man's smart casual in a workplace and event context as a ""look sharp without being too formal; it's professional but also relaxed.""[9] A jacket, dress shirt, necktie and jeans are demonstrated as smart casual attire. Piping on a jacket to give it the ""preppy look"" to downgrade formality is illustrated as a polished look. Detailing, such as a striped canvas belt and white shoes with a pair of casual trousers and a check shirt, is emphasized for a smart casual look. It is suggested men have: (a) a pair of chinos in any color from primary shades to pastels; (b) a short sleeve shirt in checks or a solid bright color; and (c) a deconstructed jacket in their wardrobe.

Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Steven and Chris explain smart casual is an ""easy and comfortable way to dress.""[10] Jeans, depending on the workplace's context and environment, are not recommended. For men's attire, a pair of khakis or casual pants with a collared or polo shirt and a blazer is illustrated. For women's attire, the stylists note the diversity of clothing options and recommend: (a) keeping the clothing pieces easy; (b) the fabrics not too dressy; and (c) the accessories more casual.

British national newspaper The Guardian attempts clarifying smart casual from a recruitment perspective by questioning various recruitment consultants.[11] They responded: (a) stand out but blend in by understanding the workplaceís environment; (b) achieve a business-professional look by clarifying the attire in advance because ""it's easier to be overdressed than underdressed""; (c) wear a smart coat if avoiding a suit to give the impression of a ""good entrance because it has an air of formality: e.g., a well-cut trench, worn with open shirt and neat slacks""; (d) wear accessories to ""show creativity and attention to detail"", but keep them to a minimum; (e) smart, plain and straight jeans are acceptable; and (f) shoes should be clean and un-scruffy.


Smart casual style, suit
Global men's fashion magazine GQ in the United Kingdom attempts defining smart casual for a job interview.[12] Wearing chinos, a blazer and white shirt to make an impression is suggested. Carrying a necktie is advisable; the author comments, ""it is far more embarrassing to be under-dressed than over"".

Pakistani fashion magazine Fashion Central defines a woman's smart casual look from an employment perspective.[13] Understanding the workplace's environment and culture is emphasized, and checking the company's dress code guideline is highly recommended. Fashion Central outlines smart casual with clothes unstained and wrinkle-free with non-loud and non-bright colors that reflect the woman's age. Too fancy or too casual dresses are inadvisable as well as the use of extreme make-up, such as using dark, glossy or chalky shades, or applying too much eye shadow. Fashion Central reports black or brown heels are preferred by women and advise to correctly select appropriate shoes for a workplace's environment.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_casual 
Teacher,"A teacher (also called a school teacher or, in some contexts, an educator) is a person who helps students to acquire knowledge, competence or virtue.

Informally the role of teacher may be taken on by anyone (e.g. when showing a colleague how to perform a specific task). In some countries, teaching young people of school age may be carried out in an informal setting, such as within the family (homeschooling), rather than in a formal setting such as a school or college. Some other professions may involve a significant amount of teaching (e.g. youth worker, pastor).

In most countries, formal teaching of students is usually carried out by paid professional teachers. This article focuses on those who are employed, as their main role, to teach others in a formal education context, such as at a school or other place of initial formal education or training.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher 
Trash Can,"A waste container is a container for temporarily storing waste, and is usually made out of metal or plastic. Some common terms are dustbin,[1] garbage can, and trash can. The words ""rubbish"", ""basket"" and ""bin"" are more common in British English usage; ""trash"" and ""can"" are more common in American English usage. ""Garbage"" may refer to food waste specifically (when distinguished from ""trash"") or to municipal solid waste in general. In 1875, the first household rubbish bins were introduced in Britain to create a regulated system of collection.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_container 
Recycling Bin,"A recycling bin (or recycle bin) is a container used to hold recyclables before they are taken to recycling centers.[1] Recycling bins exist in various sizes for use inside and outside homes, offices, and large public facilities. Separate containers are often provided for paper, tin or aluminum cans, and glass or plastic bottles, or may be commingled.

Many recycling bins are designed to be easily recognizable, and are marked with slogans promoting recycling on a blue or green background along with the universal recycling symbol. Others are intentionally unobtrusive. Bins are sometimes in different colors so that user may differentiate between the types of materials to be placed in them. While there is no universal standard, the color blue is commonly used to indicate a bin is for recycling in public settings.

Recycling bins or cans, or carts are a common element of municipal kerbside collection programs, which frequently distribute the bins to encourage participation.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling_bin
